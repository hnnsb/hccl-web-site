(Last night, last night)\nDoesn't it matter that I have to feed the both of us?\nEmployment's down\nHe tells me in his bedroom voice\n\"C'mon honey, let's go make some noise.\" (I can't resist)\nTime it goes so fast (When you're having fun)\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's just another manic Monday (Ooh-oh)\nI wish it were Sunday (Ooh-oh)\n'Cause that's my fun day (Ooh-oh)\nMy I don't have to run day (Ooh)\nIt's just another manic Monday (Ooh-oh)\nI wish it were Sunday (Ooh-oh)\n'Cause that's my fun day (Ooh-oh)\nIt's just another manic MondayYou might also like4Embed",
