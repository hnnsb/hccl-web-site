All alone\nHeart made of glass, my mind of stone\nTear me to pieces, skin to bone\nHello, welcome home\nWalking out of town\nLooking for a better place (looking for a better place)\nSomething's on my mind\nAlways in my head space\nBut I know someday I'll make it out of here\nEven if it takes all night or a hundred years\nNeed a place to hide, but I can't find one near\nWanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear\nIsn't it lovely?
