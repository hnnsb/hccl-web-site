        "lyrics": "Camila Cabello Talks Solo Music, Life After Fifth Harmony LyricsCABELLO KICKED OFF HER SOLO CAREER AND HER BAND SISTERS IN FIFTH HARMONY UNEXPECTEDLY DENOUNCED HER FOR IT. NOW SHE\u2019S GOT A TOP FIVE SINGLE, A MUCH-ANTICIPATED ALBUM COMING AND ZERO SECOND THOUGHTS: \u201cYOU HAVE TO HONOR THAT INNER VOICE\u201d.\n\nCAMILA CABELLO IS LATE FOR BRUNCH. But not sullen, rock-star, hiding-behind-shades late. More like 19-year-old, mixed-up-the-address late. She\u2019s running through the dining room of Versailles, a Cuban restaurant deep in Los Angeles\u2019 San Fernando Valley, lush black hair streaming, apologies pouring forth, having just rushed from the other Versailles, in the city\u2019s center.\n\nAs soon as she sits on this mid-January Sunday morning, flashing that disarmingly broad smile, the singer \u2014 who was born in Cuba, resides in Miami and is staying in an Airbnb here in town \u2014 says, \u201cI\u2019ve got you on what we\u2019re going to eat.\u201d She then proceeds to order, in rapid-fire Spanish, a bounty of food: lemonades, steaks, rice, beans, plantains, croquettes, flan.\n\nConfusion, stress, the promise of a splendid feast: That has pretty much been the story of Cabello\u2019s recent life. It was only a month before this weekend that she was still a member of Fifth Harmony, the most successful girl group since Destiny's Child, with more than 7 million digital songs sold, according to Nielsen Music.\n\nBefore the year was out, she was a solo artist weathering accusations from her bandmates (namely, that she quit through her representatives after dodging a series of label interventions and therapy sessions) and even hate-tweets from zealous fans (see: #CamilaIsOverParty).\n\nBut that\u2019s the confusion and stress. During that same time, Cabello had plenty to celebrate. The singer, who had collaborated outside of 5H for some time, released the darkly sexy rap-romp single \u201cBad Things\u201d with Machine Gun Kelly last October, and it climbed the charts. (It\u2019s now No. 1 on the Mainstream Top 40 Chart.) And that\u2019s not even her first hit: \u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer,\u201d her 2015 duet with Shawn Mendes, peaked at No. 20 on the Billboard Hot 100.\nShe has social numbers to rival the band\u2019s (3.4 million to 5H\u2019s 3.8 million on Twitter and 8.8 million to 8.2 million on Instagram), a guest turn on a Major Lazer song banked and enough studio time booked to successfully capitalize on what seems, in retrospect, like an inevitable transition to solo stardom.\n\n\u201cIt would take a big force to stop her from taking over the world,\u201d says her friend Mendes, adding, \u201cShe was such a great writing partner. I barely had to speak and she knew exactly what I meant.\u201d\n\nBut Cabello, whose album is due this fall, already had fame, fortune and obsessive fans. The true gift, after five years of nonstop touring, recording and meet-and-greets with 5H, is the taste of freedom.\n\n\u201cYou know that quote, \u2018In the silence, you find God?\u2019 \u201d asks Cabello, who \u2014 in her lace choker, a holey white tee and a black marching band coat \u2014 looks like the petite (she\u2019s 5-foot-2) commander of some fun and fashionable army. \u201cI felt like I could hear everything my heart was telling me.\u201d\n\nThe heart, of course, can be an unreliable guide, and by going solo Cabello is risking more than the slings and arrows of unhappy Harmonizers. (5H fans \u2014 who easily overrun fan polls, like the one for the MTV Video Music Awards\u2019 2016 Song of the Summer contest, in which \u201cWork From Home\u201d crushed massive songs by Calvin Harris and Drake \u2014 are not to be underestimated.)\n\nOnly one woman has recently left a girl group for a colossal solo career, and she\u2019s not an ordinary human: She\u2019s Beyonc\u00e9.\n\nThe closer models for Cabello may be her fellow talent-show contestants in One Direction. But none of their trajectories will quite work for a woman who has to, as it seems all young female pop stars must, thread the wholesome-and-sexy needle.\n\nZayn Malik disavowed his past, graffitied his home, cloistered himself in a weed cloud and took his sweet time on an album, all of which only made him cooler.\n\nNiall Horan took a backpacking trip, rediscovered the \u201970s folk-rock of his youth and launched a career as a troubadour, which just made him dreamier.\n\nHarry Styles is already considered a rock star without having sung a solo note.\n\nCabello, lest she be judged, must be seductive but pure of heart, strong but vulnerable, self-possessed but not selfish. In a way, girl-group rules still apply.\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t stopped her from building on her momentum, and not just by hitting the studio and bringing \u201cBad Things\u201d to The Ellen DeGeneres Show with Machine Gun Kelly in January (her first post-5H TV appearance, a month after Fifth Harmony\u2019s final televised performance).\n\nShe has also carefully cultivated her public voice, telling Lena Dunham in a Lenny interview before Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration: \u201cI\u2019m going to stick up for immigrants, and I\u2019m going to stick up for Hispanic people and their rights.\u201d\nAfter Trump issued his immigration order, she tweeted, \u201cthe #MuslimBan is dehumanizing beyond words... im in shock. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe easiest route would be to shut my mouth, sing the songs, wear the clothes and keep going, you know?\u201d says Cabello with a jittery laugh, weighing life in 5H against going it alone.\n\n\u201cI mean, [we were] at the peak of our career. It\u2019s definitely not the safe option.\u201d But, she says, \u201cI have it in my DNA. The way my mom raised me, it has always been: Don\u2019t settle. Jump and hope you grow wings on the way down.\u201d She flings her arms like she\u2019s on a roller coaster. \u201cI feel alive!\u201d\n\nThe lyrics analysis site Genius recently determined that Cabello sang on nearly 45 percent of all the lines in Fifth Harmony\u2019s songs. Even when she was doing the most inside the group, Cabello was doing the most outside it, too. She started writing on her own early in 5H\u2019s career, despite the grueling schedule.\n\nHer friend Taylor Swift\u2019s Red inspired her to make \u201csonic photographs\u201d of her changing life, so when she wasn\u2019t cutting parts for 5H\u2019s 2013 Better Together EP at Hollywood\u2019s Record Plant, she would be in the studio\u2019s gym, writing lyrics over other artists\u2019 melodies about things like \u201cmy first kiss and my first boyfriend.\u201d Then she got GarageBand and a MIDI keyboard, and began churning out \u201cshitty demos\u201d while touring malls and, in time, arenas.\n\n\u201cI would wake up super early,\u201d says Cabello, \u201cget off the bus, go to the hotel, put the TV on super loud \u2014 I didn\u2019t want people to hear me f\u2014ing yelling \u2014 then go into the bathroom, put my laptop on the toilet and sit on the floor and write all day.\u201d\n\nSo she was basically singing into the toilet?\n\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has done her 10,000 hours,\u201d says Cabello\u2019s manager Roger Gold, co-founder of 300 Entertainment. \u201cFifth Harmony worked incredibly hard 11-and-a-half months of the year. It was an incredible school.\u201d\n\nBut when it finally came time for Cabello to go solo, bitter, previously unhinted-at feelings erupted in a shockingly public way.\n\nWhen I ask her about it, Cabello doesn\u2019t shy away from discussing the drama of late December 2016, although she clearly means to take the high road:\n\n*When did the relationship between you and the group start to change?*\n\nI don\u2019t know. I was always super open [that] I couldn\u2019t just sing other people\u2019s words and be totally happy with that. You have to follow and honor that inner voice. I always encouraged the girls to do the same.\n*Do you feel like that changed the relationship, your asserting that?*\n\nI think that in a group there is always going to be tension, whether it\u2019s because of this thing or [another] thing. Obviously, I think that rocked the boat.\n\n*Have you been in touch with anyone in 5H since all that went down?*\n\nNo.\n\n*Have you reached out directly?*\nI did, yeah. I don\u2019t want to get into the details of that, because it was really intense and it\u2019s hard for me to talk about. It makes me sad.\n\n*When I first heard you were going solo, I was like, \u201cI\u2019m sure there are no hard feelings because this isn\u2019t a surprise.\u201d Then I was like, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d*\n\nI had the same reaction. I hoped that it would be a peaceful turning of the page and we would root for each other. But I only got love for them.\n\nCabello took her first vacation in five years on Christmas, after her mother, Sinuhe, insisted she unplug with the family (including her dad, Alejandro, and 9-year-old sister, Sofia) for three weeks in Canc\u00fan.\n\n\u201cThe first four days were trippy,\u201d says Cabello. \u201cI was stressing about not stressing about something. Sometimes you\u2019re afraid of the quiet. Like, go, go, go!\u201d\n\nCabello was raised in Havana and, later, Mexico City. When she was 6, her folks told her they were going to Disney World. Instead, Camila and Sinu (as she\u2019s called) emigrated legally from Mexico, spent a day in holding, took a 36-hour bus ride to Miami and moved in with a friend.\n\nAlejandro was forced to stay behind, but after a year-and-a-half of heartache, he got fed up and took the risk of crossing over. Sinu was an architect in Cuba but found work at a Marshalls, stocking shoes. Alejandro, when he arrived, washed cars at the mall. Today, they have a successful contracting company.\n\n\u201cMy parents worked really hard,\u201d says Cabello. \u201cWe always had periods where my dad would be out of a job. It was a constant flow of having money, losing everything and then finding a way to get it again. If we had food to eat, a roof over our heads and I was going to school, that was enough.\u201d\n\n(Alejandro finally got his visa in 2016, and Cabello sent her parents to Jamaica on the honeymoon they had never had.)\n\nCabello\u2019s Florida friends, who all predate her appearance on The X Factor, reconnected for \u201cFriendsgiving\u201d in 2016 and FaceTimed an eighth-grade theater teacher who encouraged Cabello when she first got into acting and singing.\n\nShe\u2019s not much for going out: \u201cI had a phase in Miami where I was like, \u2018I\u2019m going to do all the things I would do if I were 19,\u2019 \u201d which she is. \u201cI went [to clubs], and I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t love this.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAfter our brunch in Los Angeles, she plans to meet Troye Sivan for coffee and then have him and Swift over to her Silver Lake Airbnb for some \u201cchill stuff.\u201d\n\nMainly, Cabello\u2019s focused on making music.\n\nEven her hobbies serve the cause. For song ideas she mines poetry (the book Milk and Honey, by young feminist Rupi Kaur, made her cry), novels (currently: Love in the Time of Cholera by Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez), movies (her favorites include The Notebook, Titanic, Romeo + Juliet and, above all, the 2001 rom-com Serendipity) and inspirational quotes she finds on Tumblr.\n\nShe also enjoys practicing guitar \u2014 5H player and \u201csuper close friend\u201d Ashlee Juno gave her daily lessons on the group\u2019s 7/27 Tour in 2016.\n\nRomantically speaking, says Cabello, \u201cI don\u2019t have anything going on right now,\u201d although she does let slip that \u201cliterally every boy I\u2019ve liked has been a Scorpio.\u201d (Rumormongers, take note: Mendes is a Leo.)\n\nAnd when we start talking about La La Land, she winds up telling an unbelievable story:\n\n\u201cI love the movie because I\u2019m such a hopeless romantic. It made me feel like I could meet anybody anywhere. Like, yesterday I asked my Uber driver for his number. Because we were actually talking about the movie and he was like, \u2018I just came out of a relationship.\u2019 He just sounded like he was a hopeless romantic. And I was like, \u2018You know what? I\u2019ll get his number.\u2019 He never texted me back.\u201d What? \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe it didn\u2019t go through.\u201d\n\nA few weeks after our brunch, in early February, Cabello\u2019s in the booth at Sphere Studios in Los Angeles, laptop out and Notes app open, singing from a file called \u201cIt\u2019s Only Natural\u201d using her achiest coo and a slight patois: \u201cIt\u2019s only natural, I need some love from you/I might pull up on you/It\u2019s only human to, wanna do da tings we do.\u201d The vocal is balmy and bright over steel drums and Jack \u00dc-style edited vocal samples.\n\n\u201cI never underestimated her talent, but I was not expecting her to have such a powerful vision,\u201d says Andrew \u201cPop\u201d Wansel, who\u2019s known for his work with Kehlani and Alessia Cara, from the control room.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real collaboration,\u201d chimes in co-producer Frank Dukes, who has worked with Drake and Travis Scott. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s like a band just jamming.\u201d\n\nThe trio has been honing a handful of songs that skillfully blend Cabello\u2019s love for Rihanna\u2019s ANTI (\u201cI can loop it forever,\u201d she says), the era of R&B-pop that includes Alicia Keys\u2019 2007 song \u201cNo One,\u201d all things Shakira and, of course, Cuban music.\n\nThey want to open the LP with a dusty, piano-clanging cut called \u201cHavana\u201d and preview an upbeat Caribbean heater that sounds like Sia planting a flag in \u201cOne Dance.\u201d\n\n\u201cCamila is an incredible songwriter,\u201d says Epic Records chairman/CEO Antonio \u201cL.A.\u201d Reid, who (with Simon Cowell) assembled 5H for The X Factor and still has Cabello on his roster. \u201cShe is working overtime.\u201d\n\nCabello\u2019s mom pops into the studio to remind her she has a call in 15 minutes. Sinu isn\u2019t a momager so much as her daughter\u2019s right hand and confidante.\n\nAlong with the other members of 5H, she has been by Cabello\u2019s side the entire time, and now she\u2019s the only one left who has seen it all. Fifth Harmony, meanwhile, is soldiering on without Cabello.\n\nEpic plans to release an album from the group in 2017, too, and 5H\u2019s People\u2019s Choice Awards performance of \u201cWork From Home\u201d in January was an unmistakable shoulder-brush, as Fifth Harmony changed the \u201cI\u201d to \u201cWe\u201d in Cabello\u2019s opening line, \u201cI ain\u2019t worried about nothing,\u201d and punctuated it with a full stop.\n\n\u201cI know people will try and turn this into, \u2018Is she going to be more successful outside the group?\u2019 If I\u2019m growing as an artist, that\u2019s success.\u201d\n\nIn April 2016, I interviewed the members of Fifth Harmony for a Billboard cover story, and the chat quickly turned into a tear-drenched airing of grievances about the group\u2019s toll on their private lives. The only one who didn\u2019t cry was Cabello.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, my God, this is the saddest thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u2019 I\u2019m sorry about that,\u201d she tells me this time around.\n\nCabello wasn\u2019t immune to the pressures, just on the mend, fighting anxiety with journaling, exercise, meditation and music. I remind her what she told me then \u2014 that she had recently been afraid of the things her brain might tell her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so hard to hear that,\u201d says Cabello, lowering her head. \u201cIt breaks my heart. It\u2019s like I\u2019m watching myself from another person\u2019s perspective, like, \u2018Damn, poor girl.\u2019 \u201d\n\nShe did finally cry after the turmoil with the group, in Miami with her parents and sister. And then, she says, \u201cI went to the beach a lot. I listened only to Latin music. It reminds me of where I come from and that this [conflict] doesn\u2019t have to be World War III. In Cuba, people are literally making rafts out of tires and sticks, throwing themselves into the ocean to find opportunity. That\u2019s real shit. Not this.\n\n\u201cI know people will try and turn this into, \u2018Is she going to be more successful outside the group?\u2019 \u201d continues Cabello. \u201cTo me, if I\u2019m in the studio every day and I\u2019m growing as an artist and I\u2019m speaking from my heart, that\u2019s success. The results don\u2019t matter. I mean, isn\u2019t that the goal?\u201d\n\nIf Cabello is anxious now, it doesn\u2019t show. She seems proud of what 5H was \u2014 \u201cWe represented all different kinds of women coming together,\u201d she says fondly \u2014 but is candid about what it wasn\u2019t:\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t write our records. We were interpreting somebody else\u2019s story. Fifth Harmony is an entity or identity outside all of us, and I don\u2019t think anybody felt individually represented by the sound \u2014 we didn\u2019t make it.\u201dEmbed",
