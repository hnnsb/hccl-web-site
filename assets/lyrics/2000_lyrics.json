walk, talk and act like me\nAnd just might be the next best thing, but not quite me\nYou might also like[Chorus]\n'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady\nAll you other Slim Shadys are just imitating\nSo won't the real Slim Shady please stand up\nPlease stand up, please stand up?\n'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady\nAll you other Slim Shadys are just imitating\nSo won't the real Slim Shady please stand up\nPlease stand up, please stand up?\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only givin' you\nThings you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room\nThe only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all\nAnd I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all\nI just get on the mic and spit it\nAnd whether you like to admit it, I just shit it\nBetter than ninety percent of you rappers out can\nThen you wonder: \"How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?\"\nIt's funny, 'cause at the rate, I'm going, when I'm thirty\nI'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting\nPinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens\nAnd I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working\nAnd every single person is a Slim Shady lurking\nHe could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings\nOr in the parking lot, circling, screaming, \"I don't give a fuck!\"\nWith his windows down and his system up\nSo will the real Shady please stand up\nAnd put one of those fingers on each hand up?\nAnd be proud to be outta your mind and outta control\nAnd one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?\n[Chorus]\nI'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady\nAll you other Slim Shadys are just imitating\nSo won't the real Slim Shady please stand up\nPlease stand up, please stand up?\n'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady\nAll you other Slim Shadys are just imitating\nSo won't the real Slim Shady please stand up\nPlease stand up, please stand up?\n'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady\nAll you other Slim Shadys are just imitating\nSo won't the real Slim Shady please stand up\nPlease stand up, please stand up?\n'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady\nAll you other Slim Shadys are just imitating\nSo won't the real Slim Shady please stand up\nPlease stand up, please stand up?\n\n[Outro]\nHa ha, I guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us\nFuck it, let's all stand up!430Embed",
