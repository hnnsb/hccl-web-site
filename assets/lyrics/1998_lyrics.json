        "lyrics": "What Are The Best Selling Songs of All Time? LyricsWhat Are The Best Selling Songs of All Time?There is no single source that can claim to have the\u00a0best selling songs of all time. Estimates of global sales have been compiled from a variety of sources. However, some sales figures may be inflated by record companies. Nevertheless, there are some songs that have made the list over the years, and some have been ranked as the best selling.Celine Dion's love theme for Titanic\"My Heart Will Go On\" is a powerful, emotional ballad that was written for the film Titanic. The song is sung by Celine Dion, who was the most popular singer of her day. While she had been initially reluctant to record the song, she soon changed her mind after hearing a demo. It has since become one of the most successful songs of all time.\nCeline Dion originally didn't want to record another movie theme, and she initially mouthed \"I don't want to do that song!\" to her manager. However, her manager pressed her to record the song, and she agreed.\nThe success of the song is largely due to Celine Dion's incredible voice. It captures the themes of the film and communicates the depth of Rose's love for Jack. The song has sold more than 15 million copies worldwide and has become one of the most popular songs of all time.\nDespite the fact that it was written for a movie, the song has actually sold more than two million copies in the US alone. It was also the winner of the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media. The song is also the second-most streamed song in the US.Celine Dion's Silent NightThe song was initially a minor hit, but it became one of the biggest selling songs of all time. It became the official theme song of the film Titanic. The original recording was done in just one take. However, a remix in 1991 made the song even more popular.\nDespite its traditional roots, \"Silent Night\" has evolved from its humble beginnings in a small village in Austria 200 years ago. Since then, it has been performed on countless recordings and was instrumental in bringing nations together during World War I. It's even been designated a UNESCO intangible cultural heritage.\nCeline Dion's version is very different. She offers a warm, calming voice. The song is likely to be heard throughout the holidays, and its lyrics are ideal for sharing with loved ones. Her vocals are also rich and smooth, making it a great choice for a Christmas playlist.\n\"Silent Night\" is also one of the best-known songs from the musical genre. The original was composed by Franz Xaver Gruber in 1818. He wrote the lyrics for Joseph Mohr, and it has been recorded by a variety of singers. The Bing Crosby version of the song was the fourth best-selling single of all time.\n\"My Way\" by Elvis Presley is another classic. This song was recorded by the crooner on May 29, 1942. It has sold more than fifty million copies worldwide. This song was so popular that it has been listed in the Guinness Book of Records.Pharrell Williams' HappyPharrell Williams has made a name for himself as one of the most influential and successful songwriters of our generation. The singer-producer has been involved in various projects, including co-producing the smash hit albums by Justin Timberlake and Daft Punk. He has also had a hand in designing clothing, and he has a knack for marketing.\n\"Happy\" by Pharrell Williams is a bouncy, feel-good tune that has become a hit for both the artist and the music industry. Its title may not make it sound like an uplifting song, but it has quickly become a genre classic and has topped the charts. A stunning video accompanying the song, \"24 Hours of Happy,\" showcases the joy that the track evokes.\n\"Happy\" was written by Pharrell Williams for the Despicable Me movie soundtrack. The production team declined to use any of his previous songs, so Happy is a unique piece of work. It was later reissued on December 16, 2013 as a standalone song and was the lead single from his album Girl. It became Williams' first #1 Billboard Hot 100 single as a lead artist and was certified a diamond by the RIA.\nThe song \"Happy\" by Pharrell Williams has become a global hit, reaching the top spot on Billboard's Hot 100 and topping charts in over 75 countries around the world. Now Pharrell Williams has translated the hit song into a picture book for the youngest readers. Featuring a range of child photographs from all over the world, this book is full of memorable childhood moments.Whitney Houston's I Will Always Love YouWhitney Houston's \"I Will Always Love You\" is one of the best-selling songs of all time. Houston's version of the song was released in 1992 for the film The Bodyguard, where it spent 14 weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It still holds the record for being the best-selling single by a woman in the history of recorded music. Since Whitney Houston's death in 2012, her version has been covered by many artists.\nThe song was originally a country ballad written by Dolly Parton. The resulting recording was lavishly produced, and it quickly became one of Houston's most popular songs, selling millions of copies. The recording also had an incredibly broad appeal, becoming a staple dance song throughout the world.\nAfter its release in 1990, Houston recorded another version of the song for the 1992 film The Bodyguard. It had previously been featured in the 1991 movie Fried Green Tomatoes. The film's director, Mick Jackson, approached Clive Davis to get a recording of the song for the movie. The song had been recorded by other artists, including Linda Ronstadt.\n\"Hollywood\" debuted at number 40 on the Billboard Hot 100. It went on to become Whitney Houston's tenth number one single. The song won many awards, including the Grammy Award for Record of the Year and the Grammy for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. It also won the 1992 Soul Train Music Award and the R&B Song of the Year. It is the longest-running number-one single from a movie soundtrack.Ed Sheeran's Shape of YouEd Sheeran's \"Shape of You\" is spending its seventh week atop the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song has nearly double the number of chart points of its nearest competitor. Compared to \"I Will Always Love You,\" the song sold more than 41.5 million copies.\nThe song \"Shape of You\" is one of the most popular songs of all time. It is Ed Sheeran's second best-selling single, and has sold over 42 million copies worldwide. It has also set a new record for the number of digital copies sold. It was released in January 2017, and won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance.\nThe song has received a lot of criticism for copyright infringement. The song was accused of stealing a part of a song by Sami Chokri. However, Sheeran has denied stealing the song. However, Sami Chokri, the singer of the song \"Shape of You,\" claimed that the song was similar to his own. The two singers settled in April 2017.\nEd Sheeran's Shape of You was released on 1 January 2017. It has a global reach. It became the fastest selling male artist in the UK. The album spawned five hit singles. One of them, \"Shape of You,\" was declared the ninth best-selling song of all time by Billboard. Another hit, \"Castle on the Hill\", debuted at number six in the US and reached number four in the UK.Elton John's Candle in the Wind\"Candle in the Wind\" was written by Elton John and Bernie Taupin and became one of the most popular songs in the world. The song, which was a tribute to the late Princess Diana, is one of the most successful songs of all time. It's also one of the best-selling singles of all time, so it's important to note that it wasn't actually written for the Princess. The song's authors, John and Taupin, were inspired to write the song after reading the obituary of Janis Joplin.\nElton John's career spans over five decades, and his greatest hits include \"Candle in the Wind\" and \"Candle in the Wind.\" His popularity grew rapidly, with albums and singles selling more than 300 million copies worldwide. The singer also hosts his own music channel, Apple Music Show, where he hosts thoughtful conversations with rising and established artists and shares music from his extensive record collection.\nThe Elton John version of \"Candle in the Wind\" was recorded in December 1986 at Sydney Entertainment Centre, Australia. The song was performed without a band and featured a keyboard effect that Elton controlled. The song was released in June 1987 as the second single from Elton John's album Live in Australia With the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. The song was also included on the album \"Candle in the Wind\" (released in 1997).\nWhile the song had been one of Elton John's greatest hits, it wasn't always easy to get a hold of it. The song was recorded in Sydney, Australia, and stripped down to piano and synthesizers. Despite the fact that it was sung during the height of the AIDS epidemic, the song was still very popular and hit the top of the charts in the United States. One of the lyrics, \"Goodbye England's Rose,\" summed up the sadness and angst of that time.Embed",
