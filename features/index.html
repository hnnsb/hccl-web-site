          Songs are getting shorter and shorter

        <p>
          Shown here is the average song duration per year. Beginning in 1970 with 216 seconds the song duration
          increased until the peak of 275 seconds in 1990. From here onwards the average song length started to decrease
          again until today. In 2019 the average duration dropped below 200 seconds for the first time ever, in the
          observed period. This phenomenon could be possible because of the change of media. In the 70s music was mostly
          sold on vinyls. A media with only scarce amount of playback time. With the introduction of the CD, limited
          playback time was less of an issue, songs became longer. In the last decade, streaming services like Spotify,
          Apple Music and more have gained popularity and are for most people the primary way of music consumption. For
          some services artists are payed based on clicks rather than play time, this lead to the creation of shorter
          songs to maximize clicks, which explains the recent drop in the average song duration. Another factor is
          production costs, as recording long audios in past was expensive. But with the introduction of digital tools,
          this cost could be cut down.

          Based on the average values of the valence over the years, it is clear that the valence is
          decreasing. The value of valence describes the emotions of the songs, more about this can be read
          here. The phenomenon can be explained by the fact that music is not only used for celebrations or
          happy moments, but above all to process emotions at home in peace.

        <h2>
          I'll dance, dance, dance - <br>
          With my hands, hands, hands
        </h2>
        <p>
          The average danceability started to rise in 1970, with slight plateau in the 90s. In recent years the
          danceability clearly starts to rise again.<br>
          This could be attributed to
          several factors. One of the main reasons could be that the music industry and artists are
          increasingly focused on producing music that is suitable for clubs and dance events. This can lead
          to the rhythm, instrumentation, and arrangements of songs being designed for higher danceability.
          <br>
          Popular music in general has shifted away from rock music to more catchy pop tunes, which could have an impact
          on this recent raise of danceability.
          Furthermore, changes in culture and society may also play a role. Particularly in recent decades,
          pop music has increasingly focused on the needs and preferences of younger generations who are often
          looking for music that will make them dance and party. This can result in overall increases in
          danceability values in music.
          <br>
          Finally, the way danceability is measured in music may also play a role. Danceability is typically
          calculated based on tempo, rhythm, and beat patterns. If the calculation methods are improved or
          refined over time, this can lead to higher danceability values in music overall. And afterall danceability is
          highly subjective.

          Recently, however, there seems to be a trend that acousticness in music is on the rise again. This
          could be due to several factors, including a growing appreciation for more traditional instruments
          and musical styles, as well as an increasing demand for live performances and acoustic events. In
          addition, the return to acoustic instruments may also be a reaction to the overproduction and
          overcomplexity of modern music. Many artists and listeners long for a return to simpler, more
          natural sounds and less artificial noises.

        From Pumped to Plodding: The ebbing energy levels of Today's Top Hits"
      </h2>
      <div class="col-lg">
        <p>
          There are various factors that could explain the decrease in energy levels in music since 2010. In
          the years leading up to 2010, the music industry was heavily influenced by Electronic Dance Music
          (EDM), which is characterized by fast, bass-heavy beats and repetitive melodies. This could have
          contributed to an increase in energy levels in music.

          However, after 2010, the focus in the music industry shifted and there was a slowdown in beats and a
          departure from EDM. Another important factor is the rise of streaming services such as Spotify,
          which dominate the music market and are often listened to by users in different environments and
          contexts. To ensure that the music sounds good in every environment, many songs are produced with
          high levels of compression to ensure consistent volume levels. This can reduce the dynamics and
          energy levels of the music.

        <p>
          In recent decades, the music industry has shown a clear trend towards higher speechiness in songs.
          This can be explained by various factors, such as the influence of hip-hop and rap on popular music
          or the increasing importance of streaming services like Spotify. In addition, the way music is
          listened to has also changed, and many people prefer songs that have a clear and distinct vocal
          performance. Finally, there are also technological developments that make it easier for music
          producers to increase the speechiness in their recordings, for example by using Auto-Tune software
          or special microphones and recording techniques. All these factors together lead to a permanent
          increase of Speechiness in music.
