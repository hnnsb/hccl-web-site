    <h2>
      Bye Bye acoustic songs! Or is there a comeback?
    </h2>

    <svg id="features_chart" width="800" height="400"></svg>
    <p>
      The Features change over time. But the biggest differenct occurs in accousticness.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Data Acquisition
    </h2>
    <p>
      The used data of this project has its origin in three different sources. We used two APIs and received some data
      with web crawling as well.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Spotify API
    </h3>
    <p>
      We used the Spotify API to collect the song Features of the different Tracks.

      To read more about the spotify API you can follow the link below.

      here for more Information about the Spotify API!</a>
    <h3>
      Media Traffic - Web Crawling
    </h3>
    <p>
      We used mediatraffic to get information about chart placement. In doing so, we chose to use the year-end charts.
      About the song information, we fetched the related song features from the Spotify API.

    <h3>
      Genius API
    </h3>
    <p>
      We used the Genius API to get the lyrics.

    <h4>Data Storage</h4>
    <p>
      All data was stored in .json files. We used different folders to sort the song rankings by their source (Spotify
      Top Hits or Media Traffic). The lyrics for these songs ended up in a separate folder.
    </p>
    <h2>The meaning of the features
    </h2>
    <h3>Intro</h3>
    <p>
      Spotify provides numerous features, but not all of them are needed for our questions. During data
      acquisition, entries that were not needed were sorted out and only those that were used were saved in .json
      files. Which features were used for the analysis and what they say is described below.
      Entire playlists were queried and the songs from them were stored together in one file.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Artist
    </h3>
    <p>
      This means the artist who performed the song. If there are more than one artist who performed the song
      together, they are listed. You get an ID and the name.
    </p>
    <h2> Song Features</h2>
    <p>
      The following information is related to technical information of the song.
    </p>

    <h3> Duration (duration_ms)</h3>
    <p>
      The length of the track in milliseconds.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Excplicit Lyrics (explicit)
    </h3>
    <p>
      Explicit lyrics refer to the words used in the lyrics. If a song has such explicit lyrics, it contains
      words, phrases or content that can be considered inappropriate or offensive. They usually have a sexually
      offensive or violent character. Examples include texts that contain graphic depictions of sexual acts,
      references to drug use or violence, or the use of vulgar language or swear words.
      The feature gives a value, true or false. True means that this song contains explicit lyrics and false means
      that the song does not contain them or the information is unknown.
    </p>
    <h3>
      ID
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Spotify ID for the track.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Name
    </h3>
    <p>
      The name of the track.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Popularity
    </h3>
    <p>
      The popularity of the track. A value between 0 and 100 is assigned, where 100 is the value for the highest
      popularity. The value is generated by an internal Spotify algorithm and is largely based on the total number
      of hits for the track and how long ago they were played.
    </p>
    <h3> Track number</h3>
    <p>
      The number of the track within an album. If an album consists of multiple CDs, it is the value of the space
      on the CD on which it occurs.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Genres
    </h3>
    <p>
      A list of genres for which the album is classified. Several genres can also be named. If the album cannot be
      assigned to a genre yet, this entry is empty.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Danceability
    </h3>
    <p>
      The value for danceability describes how suitable the song is for dancing and is based on a combination of
      musical elements like tempo, stability of the rhythm, strength of the beat, and the overall uniformity. A
      value between 0 and 1 is given, where a value of 1 means that you can dance to the track particularly well.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Energy
    </h3>
    <p>
      The energy dscribes a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. The energy increases with the high
      speed, loudness and noise. For example, death metal songs have high energy, while a Mozart song scores low.
      It is measured with a value between 0 and 1.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Key
    </h3>
    <p>
      The key of the track using the standard pitch class notation. If no key was detected, the value is -1.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Loudness
    </h3>
    <p>
      The value describes the overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness refers to the perceived
      strength or intensity of a sound, which is closely related to its physical amplitude. Loudness values
      typically fall within a range of -60 dB to 0 dB. By averaging the loudness values across an entire track,
      you can get a sense of its overall loudness.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Mode
    </h3>
    <p>
      The term "Mode" indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, as well as the type of scale from which
      its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is represented by 0.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Speechiness
    </h3>
    <p>
      Speechiness detects spoken words in a track. Attribute values closer to 1.0 indicate exclusively speech-like
      recordings, while values above 0.66 suggest tracks made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and
      0.66 indicate tracks with both speech and music, such as rap music, and values below 0.33 represent music
      and non-speech-like tracks.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Acousticness
    </h3>
    <p>
      Acousticness describes a confidence measure of track's acoustics ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, with 1.0 indicating
      high confidence in the track's acoustics.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Instrumentalness
    </h3>
    <p>
      Predicts if a track has no vocals, treating "Ooh" and "aah" sounds as instrumental. Rap or spoken word
      tracks are considered "vocal". Instrumentalness values closer to 1.0 indicate a higher likelihood of no
      vocal content. Values above 0.5 represent instrumental tracks, with higher confidence as the value
      approaches 1.0.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Liveness
    </h3>
    <p>
      This feature detects audience presence in the recording. Higher liveness values indicate a greater chance of
      the track being performed live. A value above 0.8 strongly suggests the track is live.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Valence
    </h3>
    <p>
      A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describes the positive/negative emotion conveyed by a track. High valence
      indicates positive emotions (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric) while low valence indicates negative emotions
      (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).
    </p>
    <h3>
      Tempo
    </h3>
    <p>
      The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed
      or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration
